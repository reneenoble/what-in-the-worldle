# What In The World-le
A series all about using Python in the context of Wordle.

## [Episode 1](https://github.com/reneenoble/what-in-the-worldle/tree/main/Episode%201%20-%20GAMES%20MAKER) - GAMES MAKER
In this episode we bulit a Python text-based version of Wordle. 

Our game implements the rules of classic Wordle in the terminal, with a colourful love heart twist ðŸ’š ðŸ’› ðŸ–¤.
A fun additional feature of it is it's updating screen (avoiding a long command line trail of guesses that are hard to spot important word information in).

You can find the code for the game in [/episode1/game.py](https://github.com/reneenoble/what-in-the-worldle/blob/main/Episode%201%20-%20GAMES%20MAKER/game.py).

We also explored how to use files and your local computer dictionary to source a word list, which you can find in [make_word_list.py](https://github.com/reneenoble/what-in-the-worldle/blob/main/Episode%201%20-%20GAMES%20MAKER/make_word_list.py). 

You can watch how the code came together in Episode 1 on the [series page](https://www.reneenoble.com/what-in-the-worldle). 

## Episode 2 - FIRST WORDS
In this episode we'll take a look at how you can use Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and Matplotlib to investigate words using Data Science. 

I'll show you how to use these words to analyse and visualise letter frequence and word patterns to give you what you need to find the best first word for you!


## Episode 3 - SOLVE GAMES
In this episode weâ€™ll build a Wordle player in the hopes of beating the game we wrote in episode! Weâ€™ll pick up where we left off, after the first word, and figure out what words remain, what is the most likely, and how we can program our player to make strategic guesses. Weâ€™ll consider whether gambling on getting something right on the second guess is worth it, or if playing on hard mode could be futile given the information we have on hand! 


## Episode 4 - ROBOT BRAIN
In the final episode, weâ€™ll see if AI can help us out with our word game solver, can we teach an AI how to play word games?

Thereâ€™s a lot of sources of information about words and Wordle out there! Could we possibly utilise Natural Language Processing? Could we use all the results we see on Twitter to make better guesses for the day? Iâ€™ll take you through some code and experiments, and weâ€™ll see if an AI Wordle player is better than a human (or our bot from last week).
